# Warning

*If you do not have permission to do security testing on a site or application,
be aware that you may be breaking the law by doing so.*

While we are going to give you some suggestions on how to do security testing,
it's your responsibility to make sure you are allowed to run tools and tests on
whatever it is you're looking at. This applies during this course and
afterwards!

Trying to explain that you were just experimenting with a new tool and happened
to run an attack against https://some-company-site.co.xyz, is no excuse, and
even if it's something your company owns/runs/hosts, you should be checking with
your IT team first anyway.
