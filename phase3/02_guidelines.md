# Accessibility Guidelines

Many countries base their accessibility laws on the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG). Thankfully, you have tools at your disposal that mean you
don't need to memorise the guidelines - it is, however, useful to know [where
they are](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

## POUR

The WCAG also use four principles, which nicely summarise what it means for a
website, application or digital service to be accessible.

* **Perceivable** - a site's content and functionality must be perceivable by at
  least one of every user's senses. E.g. Choose colour combinations that work
  for everyone, colour blind or not.
* **Operable** - a site's various features must be operable even if, for
  example, a user cannot operate a mouse. E.g. Ensure it's possible to operate
  the site only using a keyboard.
* **Understandable** - a site's content and functionality must be understandable
  to all users. E.g. Ensure content is, where possible, composed using simple,
  easy to parse language.
* **Robust** - a site's content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted
  by a wide variety of user agents and assistive technologies, such as screen
  readers, both now and as those user agents evolve. E.g. Test the site using a
  screen reader!

You should familiarise yourself with these principles and what they are trying
to achieve.

The intended focus of the principles in POUR is on the users and the way in
which they interact with the content.

## A, AA & AAA Conformance

The WCAG defines a set of success criteria under the POUR principles above,
which must be met in order for a site or application to meet the WCAG. The
criteria are designed to be not specific to any particular technology, and also
to be testable (thank goodness!). They are also periodically reviewed with new
ones often under consideration, new draft guidelines being discussed, and every
few years the WCAG is updated.

Not all of the criteria need to be met in order for something to conform, but
which ones it meets determines its "Conformance Level". Each criterion has its
own Success Level, labeled "A", "AA" or "AAA".

Three conformance levels exist for the site or application as a whole - "A", the
most basic level, where at least all the Level A Success Criteria are met,
through to "AAA" where all criteria are met.

Different countries will require, often by law, different levels of conformance.

## Exercise

At least at this stage of your software testing career, you do not need to learn
all the criteria! You should however be familiar with the sorts of things they
cover and why they are there.

From the latest WCAG standard, [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) at the
time of writing, browse the Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust
(POUR) categories on the left and look through a couple of examples from the
criteria for:

* The individual success level it has been given
* Details on "Understanding" the success criterion (links are alongside each
  one, in the page)
* Details on "How to Meet" the success criterion (next to the "Understanding"
  link)

so you have some familiarity of the sorts of things that are covered, and the
information associated with them on **why** they are there and **what** needs to
happen/be seen/etc. for them to be met.
